  Filters the jobs currently on the queue.

  Filtration support depends on the queue implementation.

  ErlangQueue and Mnesia queues support filtering with functions.

  Ecto Poll Queues have pre-defined, named filters. At the moment, only `:abandoned` is implemented.

  Note:
  - This function returns a `List`, not a `Stream`, so calling it can be memory intensive when invoked on a large queue.
  - The filtration is done by the queue process, not the client, so a heavy filter will tie up the queue.

  ## Examples

  Filter jobs with a specific task.

      Honeydew.filter(:my_queue, &match?(%Honeydew.Job{task: {:ping, _}}, &1))

      Honeydew.filter(:my_queue, :abandoned)

  `name` is how you'll refer to the queue to add a task.

  - `queue`: is the module that queue will use. Defaults to
    `Honeydew.Queue.ErlangQueue`. You may also provide args to the queue's
    `c:Honeydew.Queue.init/2` callback using the following format:
    `{module, args}`.
  - `dispatcher`: the job dispatching strategy, `{module, init_args}`.

  - `failure_mode`: the way that failed jobs should be handled. You can pass
    either a module, or `{module, args}`. The module must implement the
    `Honeydew.FailureMode` behaviour. Defaults to
    `{Honeydew.FailureMode.Abandon, []}`.

  - `success_mode`: a callback that runs when a job successfully completes. You
     can pass either a module, or `{module, args}`. The module must implement
     the `Honeydew.SuccessMode` behaviour. Defaults to `nil`.

  - `suspended`: Start queue in suspended state. Defaults to `false`.

  For example:

  - `Honeydew.start_queue("my_awesome_queue")`

  - `Honeydew.start_queue("my_awesome_queue", queue: {MyQueueModule, [ip: "localhost"]},

  You can provide any of the following `opts`:

  - `num`: the number of workers to start. Defaults to `10`.

  - `init_retry_secs`: the amount of time, in seconds, a stateful worker waits
  before trying to re-initialize after its `c:Honeydew.Worker.init/1` function
  fails. You can also override this behavior by implementing the
  `c:Honeydew.Worker.failed_init/0` callback, see `README/workers.md`.

  milliseconds, to wait before brutally killing it. Defaults to `10_000`.

     connected to (your queue node and enqueuing nodes). Defaults to `[]`.
