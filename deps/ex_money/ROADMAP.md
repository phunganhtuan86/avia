# Money roadmap for version 3.0

Money version 3.0 is the next major release of Money (distributed on hex as [ex_money](https://hex.pm/packages/ex_money)).

There is not committed date for version 3.0.  It is not expected to release a new major version more than once a year.

## Planned Breaking changes

* [ ] Change the return of `Money.new/2` to be `{:ok, Money.t}` to be consistent with normal Elixir practise.

## Planned enhancements

The feature list for Money 3.0 is not defined. Users are encouraged to submit enhancement requests as issues on the [Money repo on Github](https://github.com/kipcole9/money/issues).
