# The role manifest connects a set of permissions in the system with
# respective controller modules.
#
# An association between a permission and set of controllers(including functions)
# allows a user with some role having that particular permission to
# access the associated controller functions.
#  user --> has one --> role --> has many --> permissions --> associated with many controllers
#  => user --> can access those controllers.
#
# In order to create a new association first of all a permission needs to be
# created in the system from the admin app and then it needs to be updated
# here in the role_manifest.yml.
#
# ### Example
# Let's say there is a role "order_manager", let the permission created
# from the application be "manage_orders".
# The permission "manage_orders" can be connected with controller functions
# in the following manner:
#
# --- # marks the beginning of yaml file
# - manages_orders:
#     Elixir.AdminAppWeb.OrderController:
#       - edit
#       - create
#       - new
#       - show
#       - list
#     Elixir.AdminAppWeb.ProductController:
#       - show
#       - list
# ... # marks the end of yaml file
# Then a user with role "order_manager" will be able to access the above mentioned
# resources.
# Make sure these controllers use the plug `AdminAppWeb.AuthorizePlug`.
