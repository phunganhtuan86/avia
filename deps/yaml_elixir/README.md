# Yaml parser for Elixir

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/KamilLelonek/yaml-elixir.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/KamilLelonek/yaml-elixir)

## How does it work?

This is a wrapper for [yamerl](https://github.com/yakaz/yamerl) - a native Erlang `YAML` parser which brings all of the functionalities to Elixir language.

## Installation

Add `yaml_elixir` as a dependency in your `mix.exs` file.

```elixir
defp deps do
  [
     # ...
    {:yaml_elixir, "~> x.x.x"},
  ]
end
```

Where `x.x.x` equals the version in [`mix.exs`](mix.exs). **Always make sure to use the latest version**.

Once you've done that, run `mix deps.get` in your command line to fetch the dependency.

## Usage

With `Yaml Elixir` you have an access to two methods, one for parsing a string and an another one for parsing a file.

Run `iex -S mix` in your terminal to try how their works.

### Parsing a string

```elixir
iex(1)> yaml = """
...(1)>   a: a
...(1)>   b: 1
...(1)>   c: true
...(1)>   d: ~
...(1)>   e: nil
...(1)> """
"  a: a\n  b: 1\n  c: true\n  d: ~\n  e: nil\n"
iex(2)> YamlElixir.read_from_string yaml
%{"a" => "a", "b" => 1, "c" => true, "d" => nil, "e" => "nil"}
```

### Parsing a file

```elixir
iex(1)> path = File.cwd! |> Path.join("test/fixtures/flat.yml")
"/Users/squixy/Desktop/yaml-elixir/test/fixtures/flat.yml"
iex(2)> YamlElixir.read_from_file path
%{"a" => "a", "b" => 1, "c" => true, "d" => nil, "e" => []}
```

### Support for atoms

By default, all map keys are processed as strings, as are all bareword or quoted
values.

If you prefer to autodetect keys and values that begin with `:` as atoms, this can be accomplished by passing `atoms: true` as an option to any of the `read_*` functions.

```elixir
iex(1)> yaml = """
...(1)>   a: a
...(1)>   b: 1
...(1)>   c: true
...(1)>   d: ~
...(1)>   e: nil,
...(1)>   :f: :atom
...(1)> """
"  a: a\n  b: 1\n  c: true\n  d: ~\n  e: nil\n"
iex(2)> YamlElixir.read_from_string yaml, atoms: true
%{:f => :atom, "a" => "a", "b" => 1, "c" => true, "d" => nil, "e" => "nil"}
```

Atoms are not garbage collected by `BEAM`, so be careful with this option, and
don't use it with user-supplied input.

If you enable autodetection of atoms, any string values entered (e.g. `":not_really_an_atom"`) will be converted to atoms, as well. If you only need to support a few atom values, it _might_ be better to enable `yamerl's` custom tag for atoms:

```elixir
:yamerl_app.set_param(:node_mods, [:yamerl_node_erlang_atom])
```

and then using the somewhat inconvenient syntax for it:

```yaml
atom_key: !<tag:yamerl,2012:atom> atom_value
```

### Elixir Sigil

The `YamlElixir.Sigil` module provides the `~y` sigil that can be useful for example for keeping short configurations or other inlined yaml.

```elixir
import YamlElixir.Sigil

@config ~y"""
debug: false
port:  9200
files:
  - some/file.csv
  - another/file.csv
"""
```

Use the `a` sigil modifier to turn on atom values from yaml:

```
~y":answer: yes"a
```

You can find more examples in [`test` directory](https://github.com/KamilLelonek/yaml-elixir/blob/master/test/yaml_elixir_test.exs).

## Mix tasks

Sometimes, you may want to use `yaml_elixir` in your `mix` tasks. To do that, you must ensure that the application has started.

    Application.ensure_all_started(:yaml_elixir)

After that, you will be able to use `yaml-elixir` in your `mix` tasks.
