## v0.4.0 - 2016-06-25

This version contains a couple of breaking changes, mostly due to the introduction of a `deliver!/2` (see below):
* API-based adapter will now return a slightly different error payload: `{:error, {status_code, payload}}` instead of
`{:error, body}`
* `deliver/2` will no longer raise if the email validation failed.
* We now only validate that the `From` address is present, according to the RFC 5322. This is the lowest common
deminotar across all our adapters. This means we will **NO** longer check that a recipient is present (`to`, `cc`, `bcc`),
that the subject is set, or that either of `html_body` or `text_body` is set.

### Added
* Add Sendmail adapter.
* Add a new `deliver!/2` function that will raise in case of an API or SMTP error, or if the email validation failed. In
that case a `Swoosh.DeliveryError` will be raised.
* Add Logger adapter. This can be useful when you don't want to send real emails but still want to know that the email
has been sent sucessfully.
* Add DKIM support for the SMTP and Sendmail adapter.
* Add basic integration testing. We are now making real calls to the various providers' API during testing (except Mandrill).

### Changed
* Raise on missing adapter config.
* Refactor `Swoosh.Adapters.Local` to support configurable storage drivers. For now, only memory storage has been
implemented.
* Generate case-insentitive Message-IDs in `Swoosh.Adapters.Local.Storage.Memory`. This was previously breaking endpoint
with lowercase path rewrite.
* Move email validation logic to base mailer. We also change the validation to follow the RFC and we now only check that
a `From` email address is set.
* Bump [gen_smtp](https://github.com/Vagabond/gen_smtp) to 0.11.0.

### Fixed
* Show the actual port `Plug.Swoosh.MailboxPreview` is binding on.
* Add [poison](https://github.com/devinus/poison) to the list of applications in the `mix.exs` file.
* Handle 401 response for Mailgun properly. It's a text response so we don't try to JSON decode it anymore.

### Removed
* `Swoosh.InMemoryMailbox` has been removed in favor of `Swoosh.Adapters.Local.Storage.Memory`. If you were using that
module directly you will need to update any reference to it.

## v0.3.0 - 2016-04-20
### Added
* Add `Swoosh.Email.new/1` function to create `Swoosh.Email{}` struct.
* `Swoosh.TestAssertions.assert_email_sent/1` now supports asserting on specific email params.

### Changed
* Remove the need for `/` when setting the Mailgun adapter domain config.
* `Plug.Swoosh.MailboxPreview` now formats email fields in a more friendlier way.

### Fixed
* Use the sender's name in the `From` header with the Mailgun adapter.
* Send custom headers set in `%Swoosh.Email{}.headers` when using the SMTP adapter.
* Use the "Sender" header before the "From" header as the "MAIL FROM" when using the SMTP adapter.

## [v0.2.0] - 2016-03-31
### Added
* Add support for runtime configuration using `{:system, "ENV_VAR"}` tuples
* Add support for passing config as an argument to deliver/2

### Changed
* Adapters have consistent successful return value (`{:ok, term}`)
* Only compile `Plug.Swoosh.MailboxPreview` if `Plug` is loaded
* Relax Poison version requirement (`~> 1.5 or ~> 2.0`)

### Removed
* Remove `cowboy` and `plug` from the list of applications as they are optional
dependencies

## [v0.1.0]

* Initial version
